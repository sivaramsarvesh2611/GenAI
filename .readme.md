# Personalized Recommendation System using Embeddings

## Overview
This project demonstrates a personalized recommendation system built using
semantic embeddings and vector similarity search.

The system understands user intent and recommends relevant products based on
meaning rather than keywords.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Sentence Transformers
- FAISS (Vector Database)
- Pandas

## How It Works
1. Product descriptions are converted into embeddings.
2. Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector index.
3. User queries are embedded and compared using semantic similarity.
4. Top relevant products are returned as recommendations.

## Example Query
"I need items for my workout"

## Output
- Running Shoes
- Gym Bag
- Protein Shaker

## Future Enhancements
- Add user purchase history
- Implement RAG
- Add agent-based cart suggestions
